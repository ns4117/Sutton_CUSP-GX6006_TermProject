# Sutton_CUSP-GX6006_TermProject
Nate's Term Project for GUSP-GX 6006 Data Visualization

This GitHub project is the culmination of my work on my Term Project for my Data Visualization class (hi Professor James). This project relies entirely on open data for its analysis, making it possible for other users to emulate on their own computers. 

The data for this project includes
* [NYC Open Data City Bench Locations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/City-Bench-Locations/kuxa-tauh)
* [NYC Community District Boundaries](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page)
* [NYC Borough Boundaries](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm)
* [MTA NYCT Bus Routes](http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data)
* [NYC American Community Survey (ACS) Demographic Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page.page)
